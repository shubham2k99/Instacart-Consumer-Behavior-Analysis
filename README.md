# Instacart Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of customer purchasing patterns using transactional data from Instacart. By leveraging dimensional modeling techniques and utilizing advanced data processing tools, we extracted valuable insights from a vast dataset, ultimately driving strategic decisions for improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), comprising over 33 million product order records from 200,000 users. It offers a detailed view of purchasing behaviors, allowing for in-depth analysis and insights.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- **Objective**: Ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness of the data for analysis.
- **Process**: The raw data was meticulously cleaned and transformed to eliminate inconsistencies, missing values, and errors. This step was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the analysis.

### 2. Dimensional Modeling
- **Objective**: Structure the data efficiently for optimal querying and analysis.
- **Process**: A robust dimensional model was developed, organizing the data into fact and dimension tables. This model facilitated complex queries and enhanced data retrieval processes.

### 3. AWS EC2 Instance Deployment
- **Objective**: Handle the extensive dataset efficiently.
- **Process**: An AWS EC2 instance was deployed to provide scalable computing power, ensuring smooth and efficient processing of the large dataset.
